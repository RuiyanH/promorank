# BULK DERIVED TABLES -- week 4's candidate set and week 5's ranker training
# frame. Split out from the other paths because they are the only outputs
# measured in tens of GB: Rider 1 prices the training set at ~55.7 GB compressed
# / ~479 GB uncompressed at the shipped 159.4-candidate budget.
#
# Every other path here derives from PROJECT_ROOT, and on misha PROJECT_ROOT is
# $HOME -- the SMALLEST filesystem on that machine (125 GiB quota, ~19 GiB free)
# and the only one with no room for either number. That is not hypothetical: the
# 27M-row two-tower export landed there (`EXPORT out_dir .../marketrank/
# artifacts/twotower` in job 2303121), and a project-fileset write was already
# killed by quota on 2026-08-18. Default keeps the laptop's behaviour; misha
# points this at scratch via env.misha.sh.
#
# NOTE: nothing reads this yet -- it is introduced ahead of week 5's candidate
# job (C1), whose output is the first thing that would otherwise land in $HOME.
# Stated because "plumbed and inert" is a bug class this build keeps finding;
# unlike a model hyperparameter it cannot raise on use, so it is flagged here.

# the laptop keeps it inside the repo. Left unset entirely, Spark spills to the
# OS temp dir where it is neither bounded nor visible: that is how R.5's
# co-visitation job retained 5.2 GB of orphaned shuffle across two crashes and

# than leaving it unset: on Linux it made Spark launch
# `/Library/Java/.../bin/java`, which fails with "No such file or directory"
# and surfaces as JAVA_GATEWAY_EXITED -- an error that names neither Java nor
# the path. That is exactly what happens in a Jupyter kernel on the cluster,
# which does not inherit the shell's `module load`.
#
# So only claim the default when it actually exists. Elsewhere JAVA_HOME stays
# unset and Spark's own "JAVA_HOME is not set" is the error you get, which is
